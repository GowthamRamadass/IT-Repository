create vpc
    cidr range
subnet in vpc
internet gateway -> to give internet to vpc
attach IG to vpc
create route table(RT) for subnet
    configure route table with subnet
    connect route table with IG
	(give connection for particular RT only which requires internet)
create security group for subnets
SG -> helps to configure how to connect with instance and how to send responses from instance
     configure SG by allow anyone in public subnet
     configure private subnet SG as give access to allow private subnet only for instance present           
              
public subnet(either by using public subnet SG id or ip address range)
